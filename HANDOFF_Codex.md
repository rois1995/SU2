# Codex handoff — current state, 2026-10-26

User requests persistent implementation until DC-17/DC-18 and ensuing defects are
verified closed. Do not end with WIP while independent work remains. Keep the local
[TODO](ADAPTATION_TODO.md) and tracked [progress companion](ADAPTATION_PROGRESS.md)
current. Detailed evidence/history: [curved source/construction](Handbook/DC18_CURVED_SOURCE.md)
and [completion handbook](Handbook/DC17_DC18_COMPLETION_2026_10_25.md).

Target: accepted full M6 Euler then RANS adaptation, general metric/geometry-driven
operators, q>=.20,J>=.05,edge<=1.8,h0 within10%, configured500k metric-complexity
(not tet-count), geometry, conservative transfer and restart. Curvature uses
ADAP_HAUSD in mesh units independently ofh0. No accepted full M6 exists.

ACTIVE: no owned job.52 build45125, all-worker89207 and focused14333 terminal.
52 source990/runtime19 pins verified; all receipts saved. Serial16/2532 passes.
All6 priority/conflict, flat runtime and collapse checks pass (8/9 cases/rank).
Cubic work4096 rejects:224 cells,zero shape/size failures,two surface errors.00125
against.001. Geometry priority improves51 (17 size/12geometry violations).
NEXT53: reuse duplicate-edge proposal election for concurrent refinement, before
full-star import and global proposal charging. Currently replicated edge choices
are charged independently and later lose reservation; collapse already coalesces.
Retain geometric intent when electing a duplicate owner; preserve disjoint
concurrency and all work/geometry/shape gates. Add a shared-body-diagonal regression
with one unique proposal budget, then rerun all6 curved runtime before broad/M6.
52 checkpoint pending; do not change sources until checkpoint saved.

No diagnostic output is an accepted mesh. No full M6 run since43 (rejected1800s).

50 connected implementation checkpoint7113fd984d (WIP;51 correction checkpoint b214ff210b): Runtime Absolute shape policy;
bounded optimizer repair of private candidates before publication, both resident and
streamed paths. Swaps/insertion; no smoothing/boundary operations. Construction
preserves old vertices; repair retains collapse. Candidate parameters/interface,
original-field metrics, height, geometry and progress checks retained.160 extra node
IDs separate from original construction range; actual trial/node guards. Reserve
work only for optimizer phase, refund unused immediately; cumulative160/proposal and
global limits unchanged. Collapse-filter fixture retains its two-owner local witness
layout while all ranks participate; every original counter/mesh assertion retained.
49 adds test-only complete rejected-cell dumps and optional bounded probe using
SU2_NATIVE_MAPPED_REPAIR_PROBE with SU2_NATIVE_MAPPED_ALL_WORKERS=1. Preserve its
failure evidence. Do not introduce further late fallbacks or raise limits blindly.

Other open scope:21/9,393 changing-frame gradation violations (worst1.406); M6
normal-only budget profiles exceed500k (best20 profile0 821,265+/-53,688; normal-cap21
rejected). Tangential growth outside protected band remains an unanswered question;
normal-only contract still binds.46 hidden-sphere integration passes positivity and
second moments under unchanged caps; whole-field normalization remains open.
Curved BL support/chord/quadrature consumers, FIRST_ROW surface-error demands,
fitted-plane seams and automatic curved initialization remain. Keep separate BL
refusal until its consumers are complete.32–34 full M6 original-source/field coverage

Resource rules: user authorizes up to6 MPI ranks. Check actual host RAM/load and live
handles; one owned heavy job,nice19,single-threaded libraries,ninja-j1. Ninja is
/home/rausa/Software/su2-develop/ninja; TMPDIR must be4TB
integration_evidence/build-integrated-v2/compile-tmp. Preserve terminal receipts and
source/runtime/input hashes. Build initial50 log/pins preserved separately.

Remote push was rejected by automatic approval review; destination approval remains
pending. Do not retry remote export without approval. Local checkpoints authorized.
Local checkpoint retry after review timeout succeeded (895ab7274a); no local block.
TODO intentionally untracked; progress companion tracked. Leave unrelated dc11/dc15
logs and untracked planning files alone. Git status needs --ignore-submodules.
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds permanent cadence/architecture/resource instructions.
