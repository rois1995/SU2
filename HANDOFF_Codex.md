# Native adaptation — current handoff

Updated2026-10-31. Goal ACTIVE: TWO strictly accepted ONERA M6 Euler CFD → mesh →
CFD → mesh events at50k metric complexity; actual conservative admissible transfer,
finite continued CFD and isolated usable adapted disk restart. Then dedicated BL/
constraint/MPI qualification and corresponding RANS500k workflow. Actual point/cell
counts are separate from target complexity. Geometry1e-4,q>=.2,J>=.05,maxedge1.8 and
requested heights stay strict. Construction preserves exact positive/nondegenerate/
topology/body/feature/height validity and deliberately omits q/J. CAD optional;
no-CAD geometry authority sufficient. ZERO accepted adapted M6 meshes so far.

One owned heavy job. Do not edit ANY pinned C++/test/helper/binary/config/input.
Before restart/edit/stop, reverify exact actual host handles; sandbox process
namespaces cannot see host jobs. Use escalated read for host /proc audits. Do not
interpret namespace-local resource PIDs as host handles. No perf/GDB/new old-code
baseline campaign. Counters only at existing complete censuses, low overhead.

## Connected envelope change and qualification

[Design/proof](Handbook/ADAPTATION_GEOMETRY_ENVELOPE_20261031.md) follows191natural
failure. Existing PlaneUnion envelope now tries whole nominal source-triangle
coverage when its rectangle is too broad, adds a rigorous outward box-displacement
padding once, and tightens residuals with concrete nonnegative coupled half-plane
dual bounds. Existing hole-aware footprint/index/prepared pools/outward arithmetic
reused. Uncertain bounds retain full traversal; N10reverse path unchanged. No new
cache/options/scheduler/repair slots/time limits or construction operators. Preserve
191memo,190ownership/history,whole-patch merit,oldest fairness,worst-first/rejected-
star invalidation,full-vertex-disjoint reservation,fresh curved contexts,versioned
dependencies and complete publication. Association/features/bodies/heights remain.

Analysis first: simple prior-upper+uniform-vertex-displacement bound certifies ZERO
of12saved queries; no motion cache implemented. Exact union memo hits303285/misses
293078 in191quality; misses do not distinguish changed positions from evicted
identical queries. Existing unchanged-face coverage reuse,star contexts and cheap
screens reviewed before editing. Detailed negative proof in PREVIOUS/
saved_query_motion_bound_analysis.json (older168queries,not current191population).

## Next monitoring and acceptance

Keep193frozen until terminal or preserved evidence justifies authorized stop under
AGENTS. Observe existing complete aligned per-rank censuses: net whole-field q/J-
bad removal/s,geometry-bad counts,committed cavity yield/churn,interior versus boundary
work,geometry traversal/preparation/memo,rank debt spread,busy/join/resource evidence.
Join/collective-call time includes protocol and waiting; CPUtime includes MPIspin.
Compare actual matching stages/work; do not silently equate changed trajectories.
Original-grid continued restart00000 equality verified; this is not adapted restart evidence.

Existing closure plan: shape/height → residual size → geometry-only repair via
EnableGeometryRepairs/strict complete-patch guidance,or valid construction return,
then shape remeasurement/reclosure.191never reached geometry-only entry. Same
