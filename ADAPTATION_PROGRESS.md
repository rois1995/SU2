# Native adaptation progress

Companion to [ADAPTATION_TODO.md](ADAPTATION_TODO.md), the acceptance ledger.
Updated: 2026-10-26. Detailed failures and provenance remain linked below.

## Current result

**DC-17 and DC-18 remain open. No full M6 adaptation has passed final acceptance.**
Validation51 passes all 16 focused cases and 2,532 assertions. With all six workers
active, flat Euler/RANS workflows and collapse-filter checks pass. Cubic Euler/RANS
still reaches the work limit: all cells satisfy q/J, but size and geometry demands
remain. The correction retains one shape-rejected candidate, finishes ordinary
construction attempts, then tries bounded repair before strict publication. The
candidate stays tied to the exact current parent cells.

Validation52 addresses distributed conflict ordering: wall-geometry demands take
precedence over conflicting metric-only demands. Validation52 passes all 16 serial cases and the six-rank priority/conflict tests.
The curved runtime still exhausts work 4096: all 224 cells meet shape/size gates,
but two faces exceed the surface tolerance (0.00125 against 0.001). Broader
qualification and full M6 remain open.

Required gates remain q ≥ 0.20, J ≥ 0.05, metric edges ≤ 1.8, first height within
10%, geometry preservation, the configured 500k metric-complexity target,
conservative transfer and restart. The target is not a literal tetrahedron count.
Curvature uses `ADAP_HAUSD` in mesh units, independently of h0.

## Local checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Change | Validation status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fdb6ad2683` | Persisted curved import and original-source runtime queries | Small cubic Euler/RANS transfer and SU2/CGNS reload pass at this baseline. |
| `79bfba6f8f` | Reuse collision searches, retaining exact contact checks | Connected checks pass; full M6 validation41 rejects. |
| `e398807a2c` | Reactivate curved demands; admit compatible concurrent proposals | 105 serial cases, MPI2 and all-worker runtime pass; full M6 validation43 rejects. |
| `c02010b08d` — WIP | Connect validity-only construction and bounded point placement | Validation44/45 failures preserved; not an accepted capability. |
| `3deed0ca3c` — WIP | Bounded topology repair and weighted radial integration | Validation46 fixes integration; cubic runtime still fails. |
| `4933586627` | Charge actual optimizer work and refund unused reservations | Validation47 serial passes; later six-rank qualification exposes further failures. |
| `895ab7274a` | Handle empty initial FVM graph ranks | Four-point import passes on six ranks. Distributed repair failures remain. |
| `7113fd984d` — WIP | Couple bounded candidate repair to strict construction admission | Builds; validation50 fails runtime and a fixed-cell-count assertion. Corrected in validation51. |

| `b214ff210b` — WIP | Retain one candidate for bounded repair after ordinary construction | Validation51 serial and six-rank flat runtime pass; cubic six-rank runtime remains incomplete. |

`72c4684264` preserves the repair-accounting evidence and links its checkpoint.
Documentation-only commits may follow an implementation checkpoint.

## Evidence and remaining failures

| Campaign | Result | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full M6 validation43, MPI2 | Rejected at1800s:26,567 private edits;218,099 cached invalid cells;238,305 intermediate shape refusals. | Scheduling alone does not complete construction. Original CFD state is retained. |
| Validation46 | 21/22 focused cases pass. All selected integration cases pass, including positive sphere weights and second moments within the65536-point cap. | Cubic Euler/RANS still exhausts work4096. |
| Validation47 | 12 focused cases/2,183 assertions; connected serial125 cases/1,082,524 assertions pass. | Actual work accounting fixes serial runtime. MPI6 then aborts on a four-point sphere import with empty graph ranks. |
| Validation48 | Empty-rank reproducer passes on all six ranks. Connected MPI passes114/116 cases per rank. | Cubic runtime exhausts4096 with3 active workers. With all six active, affine runtime stalls with1 bad cell and cubic runtime exhausts4096. A collapse-filter counter fixture also fails. |
| Validation49 diagnostic | Whole-mesh topology leaves the affine bad cell; one insertion/flip removes it. Cubic45 bad cells become34 with topology and88 with full interior repair. | Larger late repair alone is insufficient. Diagnostic meshes are not runtime acceptance. |
| Validation50 | Build passes; focused14/16 cases,2,227/2,233 assertions pass. | Early candidate optimization starves ordinary joint placement:69 calls/0 accepted. Valid star repair creates32 cells; its fixture assumes12. |
| Validation52 | Serial 16 cases/2,532 assertions pass; MPI6 passes 8/9 cases per rank. Flat transfer/reload and priority checks pass. | Cubic improves to zero shape/size failures and two geometry failures; work limit remains unchanged. |
| Validation51 | Build and16 focused cases/2,532 assertions pass. All six flat runtime and collapse-filter checks pass; cubic runtime rejects. | Retain one candidate for bounded repair after ordinary construction. Preserve all final gates; replace the star fixture's count restriction with an explicit volume check. |

The connected implementation reuses swaps and interior insertion, retains candidate
boundary/parameter bindings, reserves separate new-node identities, and refunds
unused work immediately. The global work limits and final gates are unchanged.
The collapse-filter fixture keeps its known local witness on two ownership groups
while every MPI rank participates; its original filter and mesh assertions remain.

## Next acceptance steps

1. Resolve the focused runtime failures; verify final geometry, quality, volume,
   solution transfer and reload.
2. Pass connected serial and six-rank MPI qualification, including all-worker
   concurrent curved transactions.
3. Reassess full M6 under the agreed constraints. Accepted Euler adaptation precedes
   the remaining RANS/BL integration and qualification.

Other open requirements: changing-frame gradation, M6 complexity normalization,
curved BL support/chord/quadrature consumers, FIRST_ROW surface-error demands,
fitted-plane seams and automatic curved initialization. The normal-only relaxation
contract remains in force while tangential relaxation outside the protected band
is an unanswered question.

Checkpoints are local. Remote export remains pending destination approval after
an earlier automatic approval review rejected the push.
